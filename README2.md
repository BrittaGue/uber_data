#Uber data analysis using PySpark

###Data

The data used in this notebook was sourced from Kaggle. The files I used, contain data on over 2.6 million Uber pickups in New York City from July to September 2014.

The files can be downloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-pickups-in-new-york-city
(For this project I am only using the data for July, August and September)


###Objectives

1. Find out which hour of the day is the busiest for Uber in NYC

2. Find out which day of the week is the busiest for Uber in NYC

3. Visualize the data from all csv files in a heatmap
